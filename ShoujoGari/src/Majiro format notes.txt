  Opcodes that control text display (e.g. furigana) and are not identified
in Haeleth's mjdev toolkit ("text_control_XX").

  0842 0200 XX, where XX:
    6F  moves text to top-left corner of the msg box (to 0:0 pixel, no margins)
    66  changes font size
    72  moves text baseline slightly on top

  MajiroArc v1 doesn't have size;
  thus, record's size is 8 bytes.

  @16:
[dw] entry point (relative to script's beginning,
     excluding header size)
[dw] (bool) usually 0. non-zero value specify to
     skip some kind of loop where it matches
     script's being loaded name with some set of
     other names (maybe scenario script names,
     like 001[...].mjp). anyway, it doesn't find
     a match for start.mjo there.
       The loop is located at 0040AB1D in exe of
     Akatsuki no Goei.
      In Katahane this is just some unused field
    (not bool), Haeleth's mjdev asm sets it to 0.

  @24:
[dw] OC | offsets count

array[OC] of {
  [dw] some hash?
  [dw] offset (relative to script's beginning)
}


[dw] SS | script size (not count)

  The following SS bytes will be decrypted
if this file is ObjX (seems like ObjV is
not encrypted format, like 'raw').

  This also seems to be the only difference
between ObjX and ObjV - the latter is not
encrypted.

  Note that max (hardcoded) str length is 400h.
